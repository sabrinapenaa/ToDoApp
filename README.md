## Notes

Having had experience with Java rather than Kotlin, I did find it a bit challenging to adapt to the new changes, such as the variables, however it was refreshing to be using a new technology. I also found working with RecyclerView to be a bit challenging as I had never worked with it, nevertheless I did enjoy learning how to utilize it.
